/**
 * @brief Class to notify when all events in the event queue are processed
 *
 * Many actions of libFunq add events to the event queue with qApp->postEvent(),
 * for example to simulate mouse events. But as postEvents() is non-blocking
 * (i.e. returns immediately), we don't know when the event is actually
 * processed. To avoid race conditions, we want to wait until the event is fully
 * processed before sending the TCP response to the client.
 *
 * A simple method to wait until the event is processed is to use
 * qApp->sendEvent() instead of qApp->postEvent(). But this does not work if the
 * application under test performs a blocking action in the event handler (e.g.
 * by opening a QMessageBox), this would freeze libFunq and the TCP response is
 * never sent.
 *
 * So this class provides an alternative way to wait until an event is fully
 * processed. Basically the start() method adds a dummy event to the event
 * queue, with the smallest possible priority to make it the last event
 * processed, after any other event with higher priority. The event() method
 * receives the dummy event once its scheduled, and calls the events_processed()
 * slot to notify about the processed event.
 *
 * But the slot is not called directly - instead, a QTimer with interval 0 is
 * used to call the slot. This way, any previously scheduled signal will be
 * processed first. So, if the application under test has emitted a signal with
 * a queued connection, the corresponding slot is guaranteed to be called before
 * we emit the events_processed() slot.
 *
 * All these tricks help us to let the application under test process as many
 * events and queued signal-slot connections as possible before libFunq sends
 * the TCP response to the client. This reduces the risk of race conditions.
